The key words "**MUST**", "**MUST NOT**", "**REQUIRED**", "**SHALL**", "**SHALL NOT**", "**SHOULD**", "**SHOULD NOT**", "**RECOMMENDED**", "**MAY**", and "**OPTIONAL**" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).

## Changelog

- First draft

### Version 0.2

## Dependency
This protocol relies on [Protocol BE01](BE01.md), in particular [the section on logging](BE01.md#logging).

## Logging Level Enumeration
Logging levels shall be attributed a numeric identifier of severity, with `0` (zero) denoting most severe, and with severity decreasing as numeric value increases:

| Numeric Identifier | Severity |
|---|---|
| `0` | **Emergency**: system is unusable |
| `1` | **Alert**: action must be taken immediately |
| `2` | **Critical**: critical conditions |
| `3` | **Error**: error conditions |
| `4` | **Warning**: warning conditions |
| `5` | **Notice**: normal but significant condition |
| `6` | **Informational**: informational messages |
| `7` | **Debug**: debug-level messages |

This table is taken from [RFC 5424, Page 11, Table 2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5424#page-11).

A device receiving log items **MUST** be able to accept a numeric identifier in place of a string log-level identifier.

## Extra Logging Level Identifiers
The following is a table of string log-level identifiers that **MUST** be accepted by receiving devices, along with their numeric severity and the original identifier from [Protocol BE01](BE01.md):

| Severity | Original | New Options |
|---|---|---|
| `0` | n/a | `"fatal"`, `"emerg"`, `"emergency"`, `"shutdown"`, `0` |
| `1` | n/a | `"alert"`, `"breach"`, `1` |
| `2` | `"critical"` | `"crit"`, `"severe"`, `2` |
| `3` | `"error"` | `"err"`, `"failure"`, `"fail"`, `3` |
| `4` | `"warning"` | `"warn"`, `4` |
| `5` | `"security"` | `"note"`, `"notice"`, `"notify"`, `"success"` `5` |
| `6` | `"info"` | `"information"`, `"inform"`, `6` |
| `7` | n/a | `"debug"`, `"minor"`, `"silly"`, `"testing"`, `"verbose"`, `7` |

A holder of a log item **MAY** exchange any of these identifiers for any other of the same severity.

## Compatability With Non-implementing Devices
If a receiving device does not support this protocol, the sending device **MUST** exchange any log-level identifiers introduced in this protocol with those specified in a protocol supported by the receiving device, with equal severity. If no same-severity equivalent is available, the sending device **MUST** increase or decrease the severity to a severity which has an available log-level: for example, a message of severity `7` sent to a device supporting only [Protocol BE01](BE01.md) would have its severity increased to `"info"`.
