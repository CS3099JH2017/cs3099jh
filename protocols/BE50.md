### Version 0.1

- First draft
- Added username availability

# Users

## Username availability
Clients can query the availability of a username from
```
http://back.endpoint/users/<username>?action=check_availability
```
and the server MUST respond with either:
* true - username is not in use.
* false - username is already in use.

In the form (unwrapped response):
```javascript
{
    "available": boolean
}
```
