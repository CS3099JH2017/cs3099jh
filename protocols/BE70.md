## Changelog
### Version 0.1

- First draft

## Dependency
This protocol relies on [Protocol BE01](BE01.md), in particular [the section on using tokens](BE01.md#using-tokens).

## Authorisation Token
A device requiring authorisation **MUST** accept an `Authorization` token (if present) as if it were an `Authorisation` token.

Devices presenting authorisation **MAY** include both an `Authorisation` token and an `Authorization` token, however in this case both tokens **MUST** have identical contents.
