# CS3099 – Basic Specification
### Visualization and HCI Groups

## List of initial deliverables:
- Functionality should be integrated within a framework of a web application.
- As much as possible, usability from a variety of devices, such as desktop and laptop computers, tablets, and mobile phones should be facilitated.

### Image annotation
- Visualization and navigation of images (pathology slides) is of prime importance. The user should be able to zoom, pan, etc. the image effortlessly.
- The user should be able to select an image from their current directory or navigate to a subdirectory.
- The user should be able to upload a new image unless they do not have the permissions, in which case this functionality should be disabled.

### Data visualization
- Numerical data should be visualizable using common visualization methods. These include the following:
	- 2D or 3D principal component analysis (PCA) based plots, using all or a set of selected variables (usually columns in uploaded data files),
	- bar plots and histogram visualization of feature distributions, and
	- probability density visualizations (1D or using heat maps).
- Clustering visualization (e.g. using k-means), using all relevant features or a selected set of features.
- Filtering of features based on specified criteria should be possible as a step pre- ceding visualization (e.g. ‘smaller than’, ’within the interval’, etc.).
- Normalization of features should be possible as a step preceding visualization (so as to facilitate meaningful display of feature types which are of different scales).
- Extension: 

### Dashboard
- Users should be able to register and set their login details
- The administrator should be able to add/remove users and change permissions for users
- Administrators and project owners should have the ability to delete files from projects

## Additional points of interest:
- It is probably a good idea to have a look at other groups’ specification sheets too, for the sake of context.
- The specification is made in terms of deliverables, i.e. it contains a list of functionalities that the client wants. How these are achieved are up to you - you have complete freedom in this respect.
- There will be opportunities to get further clarity and insight from the user. In the first instance this will be done during one of the standard lectures for the module. Subsequent contact is also possible and welcome – our client is really invested in the project and is keen to assist you as much as possible.
- Further, more advanced functionality (leading to additional marks) requests can also be obtained if and when the initial specification is met to a satisfactory standard.
- You may find it useful, as a means of inspiration, to have a look at the following applications which were developed in the same application realm but do not share or fully meet our client’s needs:
